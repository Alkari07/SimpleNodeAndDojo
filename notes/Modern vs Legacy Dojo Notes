- The core concept of modern dojo vs legacy is that things in the global namespace are bad
    - you shouldn't be just typing dojo.xxx to directly access attributes or object or methods
    - they should be passed in as parameters to a module 
- another key concept is that everything should be done async as much as possible
    - creates a javascript closure (independent block)
    - the require function makes all dependency modules load async
    - loader plugins (specified by a !) tell the loader that this module
        controls the behavior of the loader itself (ex: domReady!)
- baseless: a module doesn't load more of the dojo framework than it needs,
    rather than importing one monolithic thing like dojo.js 
- dojo/on - event handling package
    - these are things like 'click'
- dojo/aspect - method advice
    - advice adds functionality to a method
